### OPTION A: Describe the feature you would like to be added to the shader
Describe the feature in detail, so i can know exactly what you are talking about.

example: "could you add RTX to bliss? it makes it look like real life. here is a screenshot of what it could look like from another shader/another game: `image1.jpeg` `image2.jpeg`"

### OPTION B: Describe the feature you would like to be changed in the shader
Describe exactly what feature you are talking about in the shader, using names of settings that turn it on/off, or a screenshot of the feature itself.

example: "the "temporal upscaling" feature has a minimum value of "0.1". could you please allow it to reach zero? i really hate seeing detail!
you can find the setting in `shader settings > post processing > anti aliasing`"
